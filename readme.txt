Hey there this is just a dumb script that takes a lot of time for analysis, i don't even know why i am uploading this on github probably delete it in a month or maybe because i coded this entire thing in a weeknd (although the modules one was heavily inspired by a tutorial but since that didn't work) I used trial and error and (countless readings of python documentation) to use develop this script lol its shittt!

1st - pip install requirements.txt 
2nd - extract the raw data from your whatsapp group
3rd - insert file paths in the program

how it works
its sorts the data given in whatsapp.csv file and analysis the no of messages that the contacts sent on a single day and gives the report in an excel format for easier conversion( I need help in this part tho, I'll work on it after my quizzes hehe)
